<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Dwayne, 58 years old and I currently work as a junior DBA/DEV for one of the local school drstricts in the state that I reside. I was born and raised in the South in the small town of bolton, MS, but I currenlty reside in the state of Missouri. I have always been fascinated with computers and learning to write code. My hjourney in the Information Technology industry started when I received my first job as a computer lab tecgnician for an elementary school. I have been passionate about growing my knowledge in the IT world.</p>

<p>I currenlty hold an AAS in Computer Information Systems and I am seeking my Bachelors of Science in Sfotware development. I hold multiple IT industry certifications, I started my devotion to learning everything that I felt I need to know about Information Technology through online courses, paid classes and I took the things that I learned and started to apply them to my everyday work atmosphere. These skills started to build and I started to grow as an IT professional.</p>

<p>My personal interest are watching a good NFL game and drinking a nice glass of wine, my wife and I like to experience new things in whatever state we are located. i have moved several times in my life, I have lived in several states and my favorite is the state of Georgia. The sites and the scenery are very beautiful to me.</p>
